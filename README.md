# Autocomplete app

In this app we have two autocomplete components. One is build using Class Based Components, another - with hooks.
We also use youtube search API to demonstrate real api integration. (To use this feature you need to populate .env file)

### Environment variables
Create .env file in root of the project, copy data from .env.example and populate all fields (For demonstration you can use existing values from .env.example) 

### Following scripts are available:

To run the app in development mode use

### `npm start`

To run all existing tests for components use

### `npm test`

To create production ready build use

### `npm run build`
